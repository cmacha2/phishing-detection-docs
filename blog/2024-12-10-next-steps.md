With the successful launch of the Phishing Detection Framework, we’re excited to share our roadmap for future development:

1. **Multilingual Support**: Expanding detection capabilities for non-English inputs.
2. **Customizable Models**: Allow users to fine-tune the models for specific needs.
3. **Real-Time Detection**: Integrating with APIs for real-time phishing analysis.

We’d love to hear your ideas! Contribute or share feedback on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cmacha2/phishing-detection-py/discussions).

Let’s continue improving and making the internet safer together!
